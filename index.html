        <p>Hello! My name is Aaron Andrei. I am a scorpio, middle child, and somewhat of a logophile. I am recently married.
            I enjoy music and f√∫tbol. I was born and raised in Houston but am currently living in Utah. I love cookies.
            I love the Houston Astros and the Houston Rockets. I love to listen to music and I have a decent vinyl collection.
            I would love to paint more. I am also trying to read more. I would feel proud to call myself a songwriter so I have 
            been learning more about music theory and have been writing songs in my spare time. Although it has really been a challenge,
            I feel good to be enrolled at BYU-I online to get my bachelors degree. I feel like good things will happen.
        </p>
